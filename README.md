# Club-Car
Group Project for Web Programming.

In Club Car, the player can drive their car and interact through gameplay or chat with other cars. The goal is to collect Vroom Bucks.
Cars are controlled using WASD.
To run a server:
-Npm and node are required
-Use "npm install" to get socket.io, express and mysql
-Create a database called ClubCar
-Add a table called "Users" into the database (Structure is in basicstructure.sql)
-If you cannot add the database manually, uncomment code that creates it in the
server.js file
-Run server.js in node
